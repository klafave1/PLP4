## PLP4 (Swift)

#### 1. Does your language include multiple types of loops (while, do/while, for, foreach)? If so, what are they and how do they differ from each other?
###### Yes, Swift includes a few different types of loops. 
* For-in Loops
* While Loops
* Repeat-while Loops

#### 2. What is the syntax for declaring a function in your language?

#### 3. Are there any rules about where the function has to be placed in your code file so that it can run?

#### 4. Does your language support recursive functions?

#### 5. Can functions in your language accept multiple parameters? Can they be of different data types?

#### 6. Can functions in your language return multiple values at the same time? How is that implemented? If not, are there ways around that problem? What are they?

#### 7. Is your language pass-by reference or value? Check your code against outside sources in case there is anything tricky going on (like in Perl).

#### 8. Are there any other aspects of functions in your language that aren't specifically asked about here, but that are important to know in order to write one? What are they?
